    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently a web developer with Dominion Enterprises working for the Commercial Division.
      The Commercial Division is responsible for sites like www.commercialtrucktrader.com, www.equipmenttrader.com,
      www.bobcatused.com, www.jcbamericasused.com, among several others. I am among a team of two that supports
      and improves the www.equipmenttrader.com website among other duties of supporting the other sites.
      On my own, I support the following websites: www.bobcatused.com, www.jcbamericasused.com, www.wackerneusonused.com,
      and www.ditchwitchused.com. Our team also supports web portals for listing trucks and equipment as well as an

      In my personal life I enjoy being outdoors going on walks with my dog, camping, quilting, baking, and expaning my
      development knowledge.
